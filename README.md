# Postgraduate-graduation-project
This project presents a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) framework designed for systematic comparison and evaluation of static and dynamic Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) brain-computer interface paradigms. The system serves as an integrated research platform that enables researchers to configure, execute, and analyze SSVEP experiments with flexible parameter control. Here are the core functionality of this system:
  
1. Paradigm Selection
The system supports two primary paradigms:
(1) Static SSVEP: Traditional flickering visual stimuli with fixed frequency modulation
(2) SSVEP + Motion: Dynamic paradigm incorporating movement patterns with SSVEP stimulation

2. Configurable Parameters and Their Functions
Stimulus Configuration Parameters
(1) Number of Stimuli
(2) Frequency Settings
(3) Phase Settings

3. Visual Appearance Parameters
(1) Shape Selection: Square, Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Free curve
(2) Color Configuration: White, Red, Blue, and additional color variants
(3) Size Parameters (a Ã— b)
(4) Location Settings (X, Y coordinates): Direct coordinate input or Mouse-based dragging

4. Temporal Parameters
(1) Cue Time
(2) Flash Time (Static SSVEP)
(3) Pause Time
(4) Rest Time Between Blcoks
(5) Number of Blocks

5. Real-Time Monitoring and Control
(1) Experiment Execution Interface
(2) Data Collection Capabilities

6. System Advantages
(1) Comprehensive parameter control enables tailored experimental designs
(2) Support for both static and dynamic paradigm configurations
(3) Real-time parameter adjustment capabilities

7. Technical Implementation
The system integrates Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA) algorithms for signal processing and classification, providing standardized performance evaluation metrics across different paradigm configurations. The modular design allows for future expansion with additional analysis methods and stimulus paradigms.
This comprehensive GUI framework serves as both a research tool and educational platform, facilitating advancement in SSVEP-BCI technology through systematic comparative analysis and parameter optimization capabilities.
